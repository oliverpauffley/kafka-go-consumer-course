## Running
Before running ensure the correct env vars are set. You will have to had a twitter developer account and application set up. Also ensure that kafka is running first.
```
ELASTICSEARCH_URL // elastic search index url
ES_KEY // elastic search key
ES_SECRET // elastic search secret key
KAFKA_TOPIC // the name of the kafka topic (best practice is to create this first before running
```
